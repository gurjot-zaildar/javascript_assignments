/* Explain the difference between undefined, null, and NaN with examples. */

let a;
console.log(a); // we not define the value of a

 let b = null;
 console.log(b); // currently we give the value to b is null means we reserve the value of b in memory but its value is absent now and define later when we need 

 let c = "gurjot";
 console.log( c*12); // means gurjot is not a number we cant do this but we can do concatination with the add operator
